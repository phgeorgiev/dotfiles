## Install

For initial installation, run the following commands in the terminal.

```bash
xcode-select --install

git clone https://github.com/phgeorgiev/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./dot init
```

The `dot init` command will:

- Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
- Install packages from Brewfile using `brew bundle`
- Install Composer PHP dependency manager
- Install and configure Zsh with oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k theme
- Stow dotfiles (create symlinks to your home directory)
- Create a global symlink for the dot script in `/usr/local/bin`
- Set up tab completion for the dot command

## The `dot` command

After installation, you can use the `dot` command from anywhere to manage your dotfiles. The command includes tab completion for all commands and subcommands.

### Available commands

```console
dot help                    # Show help message
dot init                    # Initialize dotfiles setup
dot update                  # Update dotfiles and optionally upgrade packages
dot stow                    # Manage dotfiles with GNU stow
dot link                    # Create global symlink for dot script
```

### Package management

```console
dot package add git vim     # Add packages to Brewfile and install them
